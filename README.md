# Personal-Website
This repository contains all of the files that make up my personal website, which showcases selected (based on quality and documentation) sample projects.

**README template below will be filled out as this application is developed.**
## Getting Started

Go to TBA to view my personal website. 
If you would like to see my personal website ono your local machine (most notably, localhost),  follow the downloading source files instructions.

### Prerequisites
* **Web server stack (Apache, MySql, and PHP)** depending on OS and preferences: ([WAMP](http://ampps.com/wamp), [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/), [LAMP](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu))
* Recommended to have **phpmyadmin** working on stack. 
Note: If you have Linux and are going with LAMP,  **phpmyadmin** is not automatically included when you install all stack components. Follow instructions [here](https://www.ostechnix.com/install-phpmyadmin-with-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04/) to get **phpmyadmin** installed on LAMP.
* Vanilla installation of [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) on web server stack. For more information about how to install WordPress.org, click [here](https://www.wp101.com/tutorial/how-to-install-wordpress/).

### Downloading Source Files
The repo contains the files from the WordPress.org installation used to build the website that have either been altered or added.

**1.** Clone/download the source files and folders.

**2.** Move the respective source files and folders into the correct place inside your WordPress installation. For example, the *personalwebsitetheme* folder corresponds to the custom theme used for the website and thus should be placed in */wordpress/wp-content/themes/*.

Say what the step will be
